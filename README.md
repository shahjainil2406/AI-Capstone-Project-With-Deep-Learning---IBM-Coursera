•	Build an Image Classifier to determine whether the wall has a crack or not based on the images using CNN models 

•	Preparing the data generator using Keras for loading the data from the directory and pre-process the images, feeding them

•	Achieved 3.3% higher accuracy by using VGG16(95.8%) over ResNet50(92.5%) by implementing transfer learning
